## Content:

In this section, you will use **AWS CodePipeline** to set up a continuous delivery pipeline with source, build, and deploy stages. The pipeline will detect changes in the code stored in your **GitHub repository**, build the source code using **AWS CodeBuild**, and then deploy your application to **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**.
