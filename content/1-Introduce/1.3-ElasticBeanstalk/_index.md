#### AWS Elastic Beanstalk

**AWS Elastic Beanstalk** is the fastest way to get web applications up and running on AWS. You can simply upload your application code, and the service automatically handles details such as resource provisioning, load balancing, auto scaling, and monitoring. Elastic Beanstalk is ideal if you have a PHP, Java, Python, Ruby, Node.js, .NET, Go, or Docker web application. Elastic Beanstalk uses core AWS services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), AWS Auto Scaling, and Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) to easily support applications that need to scale to serve millions of users.
